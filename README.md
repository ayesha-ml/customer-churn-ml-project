# 📉 Customer Churn ML Project

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn in the telecom industry and builds predictive models to identify high-risk customers.  
It combines **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **unsupervised clustering**, and **classification modeling** to deliver actionable insights that can improve customer retention.

**Key Goals:**
- Understand **why different types of customers leave**
- Identify **high-risk customer segments** through clustering
- Predict churn probability using classification models
- Recommend data-driven retention strategies

## 🔍 Steps & Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Converted data types
   - Handled missing values
   - Encoded categorical variables
   - Scaled numerical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Visualized churn distribution
   - Analyzed correlations & feature importance
   - Compared churn rates across demographics & services

3. **Feature Selection**
   - Used **Random Forest** to identify the most important features influencing churn

4. **Customer Segmentation (Clustering)**
   - Applied **K-Means Clustering** to group customers into distinct behavioral segments

5. **Churn Prediction (Classification)**
   - Built and tested **Random Forest Classifier** models
   - Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

6. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Highlighted key churn drivers
   - Suggested targeted retention strategies
